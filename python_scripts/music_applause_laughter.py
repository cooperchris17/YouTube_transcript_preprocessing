'''
This script deletes all of the lines with '[Music]', '[Laughter]' or '[Applause]' in them
In YOuTube ASR transcripts, these only appear in a line with no other text
It's a good idea to make a copy of the folder (and subfolders) containing the transcripts
Then run the script in the new folder
This script will amend every plain text file in the folder (and in any subfolders) from where it is run
